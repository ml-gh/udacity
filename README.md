•	项目背景：项目涉及的相关研究领域
这是Facebook和 Kaggle一起举办的竞赛项目，这个项目的目的是通过建立模型，甄别出
•	Ever wonder what it's like to work at Facebook? Facebook and Kaggle are launching an Engineering competition for 2015. Trail blaze your way to the top of the leader board to earn an opportunity at interviewing for a role as a software engineer, working on world class Machine Learning problems. 
•	In this competition, you'll be chasing down robots for an online auction site. Human bidders on the site are becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to win auctions vs. their software-controlled counterparts. As a result, usage from the site's core customer base is plummeting.
•	
•	In order to rebuild customer happiness, the site owners need to eliminate computer generated bidding from their auctions. Their attempt at building a model to identify these bids using behavioral data, including bid frequency over short periods of time, has proven insufficient. 
•	The goal of this competition is to identify online auction bids that are placed by "robots", helping the site owners easily flag these users for removal from their site to prevent unfair auction activity. 
•	The data in this competition comes from an online platform, not from Facebook.
•	Please note: You must compete as an individual in recruiting competitions. You may only use the data provided to make your predictions. 


•	问题描述：解决办法所针对的具体问题
•	输入数据：问题中涉及的数据或输入是什么
•	解决办法：针对给定问题的解决方案
•	基准模型：用来与你的解决方案进行比较的一些简单的、过去的模型或者结果
•	评估指标：衡量你解决方案的标准
•	设计大纲：你的解决方案如何实现，如何获取结果
